## Description

<strong>Introducing Social Media API!</strong>
<br>
The Social Media API is a back-end application that allows users to interact in a social media platform. It supports user, friend, thought, and reaction data. With the Social Media API, you can create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations. It's a great starting point for a more robust social media platform!<br>

To install Node.js using homebrew, you must have [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed.
<br> <br>Once you have Node.js installed, `clone the repo` and `install the necessary dependencies`. Use an IDE to open the project directory & run `npm install` in the terminal to install `Express.js` and `Mongoose`. You'll also need `MongoDB` installed and running on your local machine. Read the [MongoDB Installation Documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/).
